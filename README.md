### Hi! I am Cristian Nicolas Torres

#### I attended a school with a humanistic orientation, which gave me great knowledge and the use of my soft skills. I studied Industrial Engineering at a technological university, which provides me with extensive knowledge about the market and the world of business. However, it wasn't in the industry where I wanted to thrive. I have decided to delve into the world of data science, and I feel like I have found what I have been searching for: where to apply all the knowledge I have gained throughout my life.

### Featured Projects

#### In my repositories, you can find the projects and practices carried out during my education, such as movie recommendation systems. Additionally, I completed an internship for a company in Mexico, where we developed a scoring system. This involved implementing a trained ML model that compares the income of a person with the average incomes of different states and various other variables, and then returns a score.
